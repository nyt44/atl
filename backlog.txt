- make Send method blocking (acknowledgement)
- investigate string_view, limit number of copies of connection string
- timed_receive
- add std::vector version of Send method in ATLClient
- ClientImpl dtor ignore response from server. It should print the message in case of negative response

BUGS:
- ATL Daemon sometimes needs system reboot
- ATL Daemon not always removes connection
